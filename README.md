# SER Final Project: Crazy Eights
## How to Play
To play the game of Crazy Eights, you run the program and follow the on screen instructions. You will use the keyboard only, and clicking outside the program may mess up your experience. There is a single player and a two player option to pick from. To select cards to play from you hands, please enter the number of the card you want to play (listed BELOW the cards), in an integer form. Do not pick a card outside of your hand, because then your turn will be skipped. Please do not use the keyboard before you are prompted to, because it may mess up your intentions when it gets to your turn. 
## Important Note About the Display - For Coders
If you encounter issues with displaying the cards correctly, and find that the numbers appear but the suits are only question marks, there is a commented out section of code in the Card class called getSuitIcon() that you will have to change. The current version Java works with unicode, but if you have less than Java version 19, it will not work. So, we made a section that displays the suits through the characters method. You will need to comment out the entire switch function and uncomment the cascading if statement, as well as change the return type of the function to char. This should fix your issue.
